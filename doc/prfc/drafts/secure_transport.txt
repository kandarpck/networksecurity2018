 The Secure Internetwork Transport Handshake (SITH) Protocol over RIPP

Abstract

   This PRFC (Playground RFC) defines S.I.T.H. (Secure Internetwork
   Transport Handshake), a protocol that provides confidentiality,
   message integrity, and mutual authentication over the Reliable
   Internetwork Playground Protocol (R.I.P.P.)

   This document takes inspiration from RFCs 5246 and 8446 to create a
   simpler, faster and barebones implementation of a secure layer over
   the RIPP protocol.

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies a Playgrounds standards track protocol for
   the Playground Experiment, and requests discussion and suggestions
   for improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   RFC's (Request for Comments) are a publication of the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  RFC's have many purposes including
   the publication of standards, general information, and best
   practices.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Purpose/Technical Background

   The primary goal of SITH is to provide a secure channel between two
   communicating peers in the Playground network.  The only requirement
   from the underlying RIPP transport is a reliable, in-order data
   stream.  Specifically, the secure channel should provide the
   following properties:

      Authentication: Both the server and the client need to be mutually
      authenticated.  For the key establishment phase, Elliptic Curve
      Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) is to be used.  Authentication
      can happen via the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
      (ECDSA).  Separting the algorithms for key establishment and
      authentication ensures that complete forward secrecy is maintained
      while communicating.  A DH handshake with an elliptic curve DSA
      certificate and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement can be
      faster than a one-operation RSA handshake.

      Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel after establishment is
      only visible to the endpoints.  Symmetric cryptography (AEAD) is
      used for data encryption.

      Integrity: Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot
      be modified by attackers without detection.


3.  Protocol Specifications

3.1.  Mutual authentication, setup

   The ephemeral Diffie-Hellman handshake in the SITH protocol uses two
   different mechanisms:
